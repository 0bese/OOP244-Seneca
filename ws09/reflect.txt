The workshop on inheritance with resources centered around the effective management of dynamic
memory in both the "Student" base class and its derived class "Graduate." Participants gained
practical insights into the implementation of the Rule of Three, as outlined in the "Student.cpp"
and "Graduate.cpp" files. These files encapsulate the necessary constructors, destructors, copy
constructors, and copy assignment operators to ensure proper resource handling. Through
discussions and hands-on exercises involving the "main.cpp" file, attendees learned the
significance of releasing memory before allocating new memory, a critical practice in preventing
memory leaks. This workshop provided a valuable opportunity to apply memory management techniques
in a real-world context, emphasizing the importance of meticulous resource handling in C++
programming.
