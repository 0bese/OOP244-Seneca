The provided code implements a HealthCard class in C++ that adheres to the
"Rule of Three" by defining a destructor, copy constructor, and copy assignment 
operator for proper resource management. The program reads and processes health 
card data from a CSV file, performs data validation, and outputs valid records 
to another file, showcasing effective file input and output operations. It includes 
functions for testing data validation and manual data entry. Overall, the code exemplifies 
good programming practices and serves as a practical illustration of C++ class design, resource 
handling, and real-world input/output operations.
