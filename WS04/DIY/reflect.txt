==============================================*/

In this Workshop I delved deeper into object oriented programming. 
I got better understanding through creating and using the CarInventory class, 
Label class and LabelMaker class which taught me about data encapsulation and 
the effective utilization of class methods. Using dynamic memory management in 
the lab, I had to manage character arrays to store strings and ensure proper 
memory deallocation in the class's destructor to avoid memory leak while for 
the DIY I tackled dynamic character arrays for label content, understanding 
how to allocate and deallocate memory correctly.
