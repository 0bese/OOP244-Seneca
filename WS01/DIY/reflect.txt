After this Workshop, I learnt the following about C++ and object oriented programming:
a. How to create modules
b. How to compile modules
c. Submit workshop in this course

For w1p1, it was quite easy as we were given steps to follow. And for the w2p2, I had first 
write out a pseudocode for what I need my program to do and then read through the syntax online 
and find what functions I will need to execute my code. 

My Phone.cpp source code defines a program within the sdds namespace called phoneDir which conducts a phone directory search.
It takes 2 parameters which are programTitle and fileName. Upon execution, it displays a title.
It then tries to open the file it accepted but displays an error message if it fails to open the file.
if file is successfully open and read, then we enter a loop where we prompt the user to enter the name
that is going to be searched. Also, if the user enters "!", we exit the loop. Upon exiting, we close the
file we opened. In the loop, we compare the string of words typed and display the number in the format 
we specified.
