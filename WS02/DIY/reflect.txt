This code manages postal code and population data within the sdds namespace. It 
begins by defining a custom startsWith function to check if a string starts with a specific
substring. The getPostalCode function prompts the user for a postal code prefix. The load 
function reads data from a file, filters it based on the given postal code prefix, and dynamically
allocates memory to store matching data in the postcodes array. The display function then shows a 
population report, listing postal codes and their populations, while calculating the total population 
of the listed areas.
One notable aspect of this code is its use of dynamic memory allocation with the new operator to manage 
the postcodes array.
