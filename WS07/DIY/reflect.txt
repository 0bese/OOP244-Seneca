In this workshop focused on inheritance, the code demonstrates 
a hierarchy of classes, particularly the relationship between the base class 
Container and its derived class Pack. The Container class encapsulates properties 
such as description, capacity, and volume, and defines methods for manipulating 
and querying these attributes. The Pack class extends Container by introducing 
additional attributes like size, unit size, and number of units. The use of 
inheritance is evident in the construction of the Pack class, which inherits from 
Container and changes its functionality. Notably, the derived class overrides 
certain methods like print and read to incorporate the extended attributes, maintaining 
a modular and hierarchical structure. This workshop highlights the benefits of inheritance 
in facilitating code reuse and enhancing modularity, providing a foundation for 
building specialized classes while leveraging the functionality of a common base class.
